# Tesla Coil
The purpose of this repository is to provide version control history for the Tesla Coil indicator by veryfid on Trading View.

# About 
This indicator reads the charts as frequency because the charts are just waves after all. This is an excellent tool for finding "Booms" and detecting dumps. Booms are found when all the frequencies pull under the red 20 line. Dumps are detected when all the lines drag themselves along the 20 line as seen is screenshots below.
